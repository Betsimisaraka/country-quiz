In this project, I created a little quiz which contains two questions about a country. This is called a country quiz app using an API, and using React to handle the frontend.

- My experience

I had quite lots of experience while doing this project:

1. fetching the data from the api

1. displaying the questions and the answers randomly.

1. Check if the answer is correct or not and changing their background.

1. Showing the score in the result page.

### Built With
