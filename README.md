1. displaying the questions and the answers randomly.

1. Check if the answer is correct or not and changing their background.

1. Showing the score in the result page.

-   What have you learned/improved?

1. I have learned how can I display questions randomly and the answers by fetchin from the `API`.

1. When the users got the answer wrong stop the quiz and ask them to try again and showing thier score in the second page.
