- My experience

I had quite lots of experience while doing this project: 

1. fetching the data from the api

1. displaying the questions and the answers randomly.

1. Check if the answer is correct or not and changing their background.

1. Showing the score in the result page.

-   What have you learned/improved?

1. I have learned how can I display questions randomly and the answers by fetchin from the `API`.

1. When the users got the answer wrong stop the quiz and ask them to try again and showing thier score in the second page.
